# Visual Cryptography
> Sending secret messages using images

## Introduction

This project requires you to write code that will encrypt and decrypt messages using a technique known as visual cryptography.

Cryptographic algorithms are extremely important and allow messages to be sent securely from one party to another, without having to worry about anyone else being able to read the message if it is intercepted. Many web-based platforms rely on cryptography to send important messages securely. 

For example, when you want to pay for something online, the online store needs to be sent a message telling them your credit card number, but you donâ€™t want anyone else being able to intercept that message (and steal your credit card details) so the message needs to be encrypted.

Cryptographic algorithms work by allowing you to encrypt a message, send it securely and then decrypt it to obtain the original message.
